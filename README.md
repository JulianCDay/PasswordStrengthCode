The two different scripts above measure the password strength of a users input. The first measures it by evaluating the password and assigning a points value based on the presence of special characters, upper and lowercase, as well as numbers, with some consideration for length. The second script measures by using the entropy password equation log_2(R^L), in which R is the different possible characters of any given character in the string, and L is the length of the password.
